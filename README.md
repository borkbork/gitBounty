## About the application
Our webapplication allows users to compare their GitHub levels with their friends, this will encourage developers to contribute to open source projects. You get more XP the longer the issue has been open, since the an issue that has been open for a long time usually means that the issue is hard, which you should get more cred for completing.

Written in rails.

##### Special thanks
We want to take this time to thank our friend and visionary, [Erik 'neon' Norlander](https://github.com/NeonNeon) who came up with this idea but were unfortunately not able to join us.
